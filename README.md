These boards have the same form factor as Arduino UNO/Leonardo boards but offer much more memory and a choice of powering configurations.

Complementary to the 644/1284 Narrow boards, I decided to offer a large choice of boards based on Atrmega644 and Atmega1284 microcontrollers. This is because when one designs a project, the question of how to power the board is always much more complicated than first conceived.  

Many new performing chips are working in 3.3 volts so it might be useful to have a board running at this voltage. Another usual requirement is to drive power components like mosfets or a small motors. 

So, why not have all the board variants needed? Here is the 644/1284 Wide & power offer:

•	644 Wide 3.3V  
•	644 Wide 5V  
•	644 Power 5V  
•	1284 Wide 3.3V  
•	1284 Wide 5V  
•	1284 Power 5V
